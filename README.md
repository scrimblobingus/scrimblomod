# scrimblo mod - a cryptid addon that exists
This mod requires cryptid and thus also requires talisman.
Known issues:
Conflicts with Yahimod 2.1 due to it not supporting talisman.(2.0 works fine)
stickers do not display right on zombieman6475 due to the card art being way bigger than the other jokers(i'd make it smaller but it doesn't look good)
